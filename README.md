# Regarding the content of the file
The app is a personal calculator, a basic one, with all the basic functions embedded in it.

App created in Python v.3.4.0. using PyQt 4

We click on buttons to input values and perform operations.

Angle measured can be specified by choosing either "Deg" or "Rad", i.e., by choosing either
degree measurements or radian measurements.

After each calculation is over, just click on the C button to start a new calculation.

There are four variables x1,x2,x3,x4 (storage areas in memory) storing values inputted by the user,
e.g. very long values or some scientific constants can be stored in them.

To store a value in a variable, just enter the value and click on the variable button in which you want it
to be stored.

In order to retrieve the value of a variable, just click on that button.

To perform operations using variables, click on the buttons and after every operation, press the "=" button,e.g.,
to calculate x1+x2+x3+x4, press x1+x2, then "=", then + x3 , then "=", and finally + x4 "=" .
